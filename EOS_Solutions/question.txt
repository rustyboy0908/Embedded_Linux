1. Open the file /usr/share/dictionary.txt in process P1 and send the strings starting with letter 'm' to process P2 using message queues. In process P2 find and print the length of string.                                                                                                                                          
2. Open the file /usr/share/dictionary.txt in process P1 and send the strings starting with letter 'm' to process P2 using share memory. In process P2 find and print the length of string.
3. Open the file /usr/share/dictionary.txt in process P1 which is a parent. Create two child process using fork. Child 1 searches for a word from the top of the file and child 2 search from bottom of the file. The word is provided by parent Process. Whichever child finds it prints the message "Found"
4. Open the file /usr/share/dictionary.txt in process P1 and send the strings starting with letter 'm' to process P2 using pipes. In process P2 find and print the length of string.
